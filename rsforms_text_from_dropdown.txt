Code to save the text from a dropdown field in addition to the value(useful when you need the value and also the text in separate fields)

Step 1: add this code to the Attribute field in the dropdown form field:
onchange="getText('put_your_dropdown_field_name_here');"

Step 2: add a hidden field to your form to hold the dropdown text

Step 3: add this code to the form Properties in the Javascript box:

<script>
function getText(fieldname)
{
var index  = document.getElementById(fieldname).selectedIndex;
var option = document.getElementById(fieldname).options[index];
document.getElementById('put_your_hidden_field_name_here').value = option.text;
}
</script>

Now when your dropdown is changed, you hidden field will receive the text of the dropdown for its value
This way you can see both in your submissions

This was adapted from the RSForms forum but that code didn't work (mucho typos)
